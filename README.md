### Get Started: Edu-Track App

This guide will walk you through setting up the **Edu-Track App** project, including installing dependencies and running the project using Vite.

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evansnguyen/edu-track-app.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd edu-track-app
```

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Next, install the necessary project dependencies. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as you'll need it for package management.

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

To run the project locally using Vite, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you'll see output in your terminal, indicating that Vite is building and serving your project.

By default, Vite runs on `http://localhost:5173/`. Open that URL in your browser to view the app.
